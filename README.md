### 😔 Challenges Faced and Conquered 😃

There were many challenges at every step of the way but the honorable mentions are:

-   Handeling Menu Schema and creating CRUD functionality for each menu item.
-   Implementing Search functionality for menu items as I had to do a lot of research and used MongoDB aggregation framework to $unwind the 'menu'array in each restaurant, converting it into separate document, then $match the menu items based on search query and finally $project the desired fields for the result
-   Implementing Distance Matrix Api to calculate the distance between the user address and the restaurant address

### 🚀 Next Steps

-   Limit the user from adding duplicate dishes to the menu
-   Displaying the quantity of each dish user adds to their order.
